  - Legitimate administrator account lockouts and subsequent unlocks can trigger this rule. Tune by adjusting the failed logon threshold or by excluding specific service accounts known to have complex password policies. Correlate with other anomalous activity (e.g., logons from unusual locations or times) to reduce noise.
