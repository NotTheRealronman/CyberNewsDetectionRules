  timeframe: 5m
  condition: selection | count() by user.name, source.ip >= 5
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate administrator accounts failing to log in due to forgotten credentials or misconfigured clients.
  - Penetration testing or authorized security scanning.
  - If the GMS is exposed to the public internet, this rule will be very noisy. It is recommended to filter for specific user accounts known to be targeted or to only alert on a high number of distinct IPs (e.g., 10+).
