detection:
  selection:
    event.type: 'delete'
    event.name: 'remove'
  volume:
    event.count: '>100'
  timeframe: 5m
  condition: selection and volume
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate bulk file cleanup operations
  - Automated data retention policy enforcement
  - User-initiated mass deletions during account migration
  - To reduce false positives, establish baselines for normal user behavior and consider implementing approval workflows for bulk deletions
