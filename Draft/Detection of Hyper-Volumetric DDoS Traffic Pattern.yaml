title: Detection of Hyper-Volumetric DDoS Traffic Pattern
id: 
status: draft
description: Detects network traffic patterns consistent with hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks similar to those attributed to the AISURU botnet, characterized by exceptionally high throughput (terabits per second) and packet rates from distributed sources.

    # Look for exceptionally high traffic volume thresholds indicative of hyper-volumetric attacks.
    # These thresholds should be adjusted based on baseline network capacity.
    bytes_out|gt: 1000000000000  # 1 Terabit threshold proxy (adjust per environment)
    # AND/OR look for high packet rate from numerous unique source IPs to a single or small set of destinations.
    packet_rate|gt: 10000000  # 10 million packets per second as a potential indicator

falsepositives:
  - Legitimate large-scale data transfers (e.g., content delivery, scientific data replication, major software updates).
  - Scheduled network stress tests or maintenance windows.
  - High-traffic events (e.g., product launches, live streaming events). Tuning requires establishing a baseline for normal peak traffic and adjusting thresholds accordingly. Implementation should consider rate-limiting or threshold-based alerts from edge network devices (routers, firewalls, DDoS mitigation appliances).
